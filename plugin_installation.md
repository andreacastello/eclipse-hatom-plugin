After downloading the plugin's JAR distribution (ie: HatomPlugin\_x\_y\_z.jar), it can be installed into the platform by simply placing it into the IDE's **plugin** directory.

The IDE must be restarted; after that the plugin is ready to use.

If the hatom validation button appears in Eclipse main toolbar, the plugin has been successfully installed.
