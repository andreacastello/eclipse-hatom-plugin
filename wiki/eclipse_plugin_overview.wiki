#labels Phase-Support
This page is an overview of implemented features in the *hAtom plugin for Eclipse 3.4 (Ganymede)*.

==Code completion==

Completion (or Code Assist in Eclipse docs), has been written from scratch to handle XHTML 1.0 tags and hAtom microformats separately. Code assist is activated with a CTRL+SPACE shortcut; a popup containing either XHTML tags or hAtom keywords is opened. XHTML tags are shown whenever the editor cursor is placed in a XHTML tag part that is _not_ an attribute value. When cursor is placed inside an attribute value, hAtom completion is performed. No completion popup is opened inside comments or processing instruction tags.

Both XHTML and hAtom suggestion are filtered while the user types. Current version does not support Documentation assist (as happens in Netbeans plugin).

==Code Highlight==

The default color for hAtom keywords highlight is crimson. This setting can be changed using the dedicated Preferences item in&nbsp; *Window > Preferences > Hatom Editor*, where the following preferences can be edited:
* hAtom keyword color
* XML string (attribute values that are NOT hAtom keywords)
* XHTML tags
* XML processing instruction

* XHTML DOCTYPE declaration

==Validation==

\\

Hatom validation process is started by clicking the button with the microformats icon on the main toolbar. !https://forge.pronetics.it/confluence/download/attachments/7536709/hatomButton.png!

For every file to be validated, a new output tab is opened, as shown in the picture below. Error reports can be explored using the down and up arrows placed on the upper-right corner of the validation view. The currently selected report is highlighted in blue. Every error report item is a row in the view, and shows
* the error message
* the complete node that contains the error
* the path of the wrong node tag (if available) with the following form: _html > body > div_
* the total number of errors occurred

Note that the current version +supports only one validation at the time+, every new validation task must wait for a previous validation to end before it could be started.
